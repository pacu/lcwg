## Roadmap for next ECC Sprint
Android has Automatic Auto-Shielding in place and is being tested internally on ECC. Some devs from this calls were added to the beta testing
Explained what the A2S workflow does

iOS will be releasing tag 115 that includes the new shielding phases that are on par with Android ones and added fetching phase to depict the retrieval of UTXOs

On the A2S workflow it will be implemented on the following week and released internally.

Request from @nighthawk24: make A2S threshold `1 ZEC + fee amount` so the UI is clearer
