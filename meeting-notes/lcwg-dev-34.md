# 1. General Notes
* Android SDK
  - Type safe memos - computerized memo will not break the wallet, safe parsing of bytes is possible
  - Types for every address and key, changes across all public APIs
  - GRPC updated to 1.10
* iOS SDK
  - New iOS 16 should be mostly compatible, no issues expected 
  - Code deprecations donâ€™t hit us hard as we are using new technologies
  - DAG-sync changes will take time to integrate

Switch to swift package manager for Nighthawk recommended
