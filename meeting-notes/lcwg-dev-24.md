# 1. General Notes
* Nighthawk Updates
  - Wallet Screen Design and Navigation component development in progress.
* General
  - Deriving T-addresses from UA to provide to exchanges that support only transparent address type.
  - Waiting on Zcash Android SDK Beta 20 to be tagged.
  - Zcash SDK Progress: Making SDK type safe support, working to making derivation tools private & compact block processor class as internal.
  - UX idea to reduce showing the T-address as much as possible as UA becomes the go to proxy.
  - Recommend moving to ZcashLightClientKit 13 for shorter build times.
  - Discuss issues around scanning being reset on Android client - need more logs for further evaluation. Plan to get the synchronizer to be tied to the most long lived section of the app for stable operation.
