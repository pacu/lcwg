# 1. General Notes
- This meeting was done "Async" since @Pacu had connectivity problems. 
- Adi requested that the SDK allow clients to define the number of confirmations to use at the moment of sending funds, getting a balance, etc. He filed a github issue under the android repo to be discussed the implications of such a change there
