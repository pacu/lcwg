# Light Client Working Group - Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management for various initiatives affecting Zcash light clients. The main use of this repository is for the LCWG bi-weekly meeting. It is setup and modeled after the [Ethereum Project Management Repository](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/) under the guidance and direct advice of it's creator @Souptacular, building on 4+ years of lessons learned [herding cats on ETH](https://www.ethereumcatherders.com/).

## LCWG Devs Meetings

### Purpose
The Light Client Working Group Devs meeting is a technical call intended to bring together various development teams who play major roles in determining the direction of light clients. Zcash light client teams provide updates on their projects, discuss various open issues and [ZIPs](https://zips.z.cash/) related to light client work, and support each other as we build the connection between users and Zcash.

### Agendas

The agendas for the calls are tracked in the Issues tab of this repository, under the "agenda" label ([link](https://github.com/zcash/lcwg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aagenda+)). To add an item to an agenda, please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/zcash/lcwg/issues/new) which mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (ZIPs, prototypes, github issues, etc.). Then, leave a comment in the agenda where you would like this to be discussed. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/289#issuecomment-809501046).

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:
- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves light clients at a low-level.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The LCWG developer meetings are not meant to decide contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend
Light client developers, Protocol developers, and lightwalletd developers are invited to attend the meetings. This is not a meeting for passive participants. The primary guidelines are:
#### Attendance Guidelines
- You have been actively pushing PRs to wallet projects
  - For at least the last 6 moths
  - At least X PRs total
Generally every light client is represented. Sometimes a non-developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to @gmale.
